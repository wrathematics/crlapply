Title: Checkpoint/Restart Lapply
Version: 0.2-0
Description: Checkpoint/restart is a useful strategy for running expensive
    functions in constrained environments (non-reliable hardware, restricted
    time limits, etc). This package adds an lapply-like function that
    automatically handles checkpointing.
